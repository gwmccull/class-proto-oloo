This repo is an example I wrote for a blog post comparing the same object inheritance model using ES6 Classes, 
Prototypal Inheritance, and Objects Linked to Other Objects (OLOO) syntax.

The example shows inheritance between an Animal base object, a Dog child object and an instance of Dog called Doug.
